## [python-twitter-bot](https://github.com/s0uthk1ng/python-twitter-bot)
- Writing a Twitter bot is fun. Runs in android app via #termux. The first part of the code reads the line in file(tweetthis.txt) and tweets it. Used python - twython and textblob (to filter based on sensitivity). Second part is to search the string in tamil or english which has more than specified no of retweets/likes and with sensitive score more than 0.25.
- #tbot.py
This is the enhanced version of python-twitter-bot, thats liked with heroku and it does not support any dynamic arguments. Eventhing need to be hardcoded on the file before you run it.
